The Institution Name column is only used internally for administration ease. Users will not see data in this field--It's simply meant to help you as an administrator.,"Every college/higher-ed institution in the country has a Title IV code. Title IV codes can be looked up here: http://www.finaid.org/fafsa/tiv.phtml This value MUST be a 6 digit code. You may need to set your version of Excel or Numbers to allow leading zeros in this value, e.g. '005204' not '5204'. ","Users see the program title in program listings, single program pages, and search results. The program title should be short and descriptive. An asterisk (*) can be used at the end of the program title to indicate the program is supported by the Maine University Colleges. ","Program types are used to sort programs on the website. Valid values are 'bachelor', 'associate', 'certificate', and 'master'. ","Valid values for program level include, but are not limited to: 'graduate', 'undergraduate', and 'non-credit'. ","Program format is used by users to filter & sort programs in the programs list. Valid values include 'online', 'classroom', and 'hybrid' (meaning the course meets both online and in the classroom).","Location is used to describe the physical location students meet for classroom and hybrid classes. Example values include, but are not limited to: 'bangor' or 'augusta'. A value of 'statewide' indicates to users that the program is online and that location is not a factor. ","Program schedule only has two values, 'flexible' or 'fixed'. For example, a stay-at-home dad might only be able to take online courses at night, and is looking for a program with a 'flexible' schedule. ","Enter the web page address for the program, if one exists. This web page should include all additional program data not listed on Next Step Maine, and the page should have clear instructions on the user's next step, whether it's to call Admissions or do another action. When a user clicks on the Next Step Maine website to view additional program details they'll be taken to this page. NOTE: This value must include http:// at the beginning of the url, i.e. http://www.nextstepmaine.org/","This field is used to give users a good idea how long the program will take them to complete. If the program has a 'flexible' schedule a value of 'variable' is acceptable. Otherwise please specify the time length in hours, e.g. '34 hours'.",This is the average cost per credit. An acceptable value would be '$200 per credit'. Users will sort by this data to view the most affordable programs for their budget. ,"Categories are used to describe a program with keywords that users will search for. If you have more than one category for your program, please separate them with a comma. E.g. ""business, accounting, finance"" Categories will also be used to correlate jobs with programs, example: A user looking at an Accounting program would be recommended jobs also categorized as 'accounting'. ","Please describe your program in detail. There is no limit to the description length, so please be thorough. Users researching the programs on Next Step Maine will be reading these descriptions in order to decide which program(s) and institutions they will enroll in. The language in the program description will sometimes be the first copy a user is reading from your institution. Using inviting and detailed descriptions incite users to learn more about your institution and programs."
NOTES ABOUT ENTERING DATA: All data should be lower case and singular. Example: 'bachelor' not 'Bachelors' or 'applied science' not 'Applied Science' or 'bangor' not 'Bangor'. The Next Step Maine website will case and pluralize content as needed to produce grammatically correct copy. Having uniform data like this makes it easier for users to search the website. ,,,,,,,,,,,,

University of Maine,002053,CHEMICAL ENGINEERING,bachelor,,classroom,Orono,flexible,http://www.umche.maine.edu/chb/undergrad/default.htm,Variable,$279 per credit,ENGINEERING,"Chemical Engineers are concerned primarily with the design, operation and management of processing systems to alter and upgrade raw materials into products that are more useful to society (and therefore more valuable). In the design and operation of such facilities two competing concerns are generally paramount: the need to minimize both costs and environmental impact. Since chemical engineers are employed in many different industries, the basic training is general and not industry-specific. The Bachelor of Science program in Chemical Engineering is broadly based and built on a thorough grounding in mathematics, physics and chemistry followed by the study of thermodynamics, kinetics, fluid mechanics and unit operations. Economics, process design and more specialized technical electives are studied during the final year. Key objectives of the program are to develop analytical and problem solving skills, communication skills and a level of general education that will allow the graduate to function effectively as a chemical engineer in the twenty-first century. Our objectives are that in the time frame of three to five years after graduation our students will: Hold positions that utilize their engineering training and have advanced in their job responsibilities, or be pursuing postgraduate education, Be working as engineering professionals, act ethically by adhering to standards and being committed to the health and safety of employees and the general population, Be pursuing innovative solutions to current societal challenges and continue to improve themselves through a variety of learning opportunities, Contribute to their employer and society by working effectively in the global economy, contribute to professional, civic, or governmental organizations, be leading or working collaboratively in teams, and be communicating with diverse groups. The program requires successful completion of 130 credits of course work with a minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.0 in Chemical and Biological Engineering courses, including technical electives credits. The program can be completed in four academic years of full time study. It is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, 111 Market Place, Suite 1050, Baltimore, MD 21202-4012 - telephone: (410) 347-7700."

University of Maine,002053,CIVIL ENGINEERING,bachelor,,classroom,Orono,flexible,http://www.civil.umaine.edu/,Variable,$279 per credit,ENGINEERING,"The multifaceted nature of this society-serving profession dictates that civil engineers have proficiency in four areas: structural, geotechnical, environmental/water resources, and transportation engineering. To achieve that objective, students need to be proficient in mathematics through differential equations; probability and statistics; calculus-based physics; and general chemistry. The ability to conduct laboratory experiments and to critically analyze and interpret data in more than one of the four above-mentioned major areas is emphasized throughout the program. Design is integrated throughout the professional component of the curriculum by means of design experiences and by functioning on multidisciplinary teams.Since civil and environmental engineering is a “societal” profession, our engineers may also be faced with economic, ethical, political, social, and legal issues. Moreover, civil engineers must be able to communicate effectively both orally and in writing. Therefore, societal issues and communication skills are emphasized in our civil and environmental engineering courses. Moreover, the curriculum provides for “Human Values and Social Context” courses, including ethics, writing and public speaking. A senior “capstone” course, taken in the spring semester of the senior year, provides students an opportunity to “put it all together” around an active civil engineering project, while gaining understanding of professional practice issues."

Students pursue such questions as these: How do we use the power of language within personal relationships? How do the stories we tell in conversation provide meaning and significance to the identities we fashion for ourselves, or cultures? What communication practices do we engage in to maintain and build organizations? What rhetorical strategies do we employ to spin new social webs or tear down old ones?

In consultation with an academic advisor the student plans a program based on the approved Mechanical Engineering Curriculum. The format is a suggested program which can be modified within constraints of satisfying all the requirements and course prerequisites to satisfy scheduling needs or student preferences. The program has ten elective courses among the 42 courses required for the degree. Six of the electives must be approved courses in Human Values and Social Contexts, and four must be technical with the courses selected from specified groups. Lists of courses qualifying for these electives are also available in the Mechanical Engineering office. By careful use of this flexibility in electives, students may pursue in some depth their particular interests in both technical and non-technical subjects. Some Mechanical Engineering electives will not be offered every year. Students may wish to declare a double major or obtain a second degree. One common choice is to combine mechanical and electrical engineering. A minimum of one extra year is ordinarily required for a double major or a double degree. The student should see his or her academic advisor early in the program to be sure all requirements are being met. The Mechanical Engineering Department provides the students the opportunity to participate in a co-operative education course, MEE 394 – Mechanical Engineering Practice. The course is under the direction of Associate Professor Mike Boyle who is the mechanical engineering co-op advisor who monitors the student’s progress in the course. The course generally requires that appropriate project work be assigned by the co-operating company or agency. Students who are enrolled in the undergraduate program can undertake an integrated program where the requirements of the fourth year of their basic curriculum and the additional courses of the five-year option are distributed to reinforce each other over the last two years of a five-year program. This five-year pulp and paper option in Mechanical Engineering is described in detail in the Chemical Engineering section of the University of Maine Undergraduate Catalog.. The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering degree and a pulp and paper certificate are awarded concurrently at the end of the fifth year of study."

With 9 faculty and about 24 graduate students, the graduate program in Wildlife Ecology is large enough to create a stimulating environment, but small enough for students to receive individual attention. Close relationships with many federal and state agencies and private conservation organizations provide a substantial funding base and a network for collaborative research. The faculty also are joined in research and graduate student advising by several cooperating faculty and research associates.  Biologists from the U.S. Geological Survey, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service stationed on or near campus participate in the program and add to the research specialties of the faculty.
